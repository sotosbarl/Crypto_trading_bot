This is a compilation of all our attempts to create an automatic winning strategy for trading Cryptocurrencies. Well-known technical analysis tools and 
indices are calculated and used to develop different strategies. We also trained and implemented a Random Forest Classifier for determing whether to enter in a trade or not, given the values of certain indices.
We load a csv file with minute data of Bitcoin-Euro price and we use it for backtesting. The win-loss statistics are produced in the end.
